# Super Duper Password Utility Tool 9001

## Description

This project contains all the work that our group did for the CMP311 Professional Project module. The team were given a range of briefs to choose from and decided upon a tool to help educate users on password security and how they can make more secure passwords. The planned users of this solution are users of the Abertay University IT system meaning they have an account assigned to them on this. The hope is with the development of this project we can better increase there security.

We spent a lot of time planning out our solution and came to the conclusion that our final solution would consist of 3 main fundamental parts. 

---
### The API(Application Programming Interface)
This will be hosted on the abertay servers and will act as the backend of our project. This contains functions that will generate a complexity score on a range of factors. This will also check against common attack dictionaries for the password and send a notification if the user has used the password before.

---
### Android Application
This will be an android app that will run on android 10 (API29). The users will be able to use this to log in to an account if they are registered and to check the security of there password from here it will then give the information relevant well founded research on there chosen password and inform them how to improve it.

### Chrome Extension
This will be  browser extension ran on google chrome. The users will be able to use this to log in to an account if they are registered and to check the security of there password from here it will then give the information relevant well founded research on there chosen password and inform them how to improve it.
