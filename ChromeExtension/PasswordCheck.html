                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Length can be the single most important indicator of a strong password. This is because longer passwords have more permutations making them far harder to guess. However, this is only effective if paired with sufficient complexity.</p>

						<h2>One strategy to ensure a long and memorable password is using multiple words or a phrase. This can be achieved by choosing uncommon words for example, local businesses, historical figures, and words in another language. Making the words uncommon will make it almost unguessable for a hacker. However, it is best to compose a phrase will give a mental image, making it more memorable.</h2>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The complexity of a password is what ensures that it is not easily guessable. This consists of aspects such as numbers, symbols and letters. The difficulty is in achieving complexity while still keeping the password memorable.</p>

					<br><br>
					<div id="complexity" style="display: none;" class="advice">
						<h2>There are a number of practices that can help increase the complexity of a password. One is to add symbol/s at the beginning and/or end of the password. Another is to capitalise some of the characters. For example, the first and last three or every second or third character. Coming up with a memorable system is important for achieving a complex and memorable password.</h2>

                <button class="accordion" id="repeatingBox">Repeating Characters</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Identifying repeating characters is important as even if a password is long, if it consists of a string of the same character i.e. “aaaaaaaaaa” then it is still weak. However, it is not a problem to have some repeating characters within a strong password. For example, “Aswtsss” is not made weaker by the inclusion of “sss”. But a password such as “aaaaabbbbbccccc” will still be guessed faster by certain algorithms.</p>

					<div id="repeating" style="display: none;" class="advice">
						<h2>To ensure that a password does not repeat the same character/s it can help to increase the length of a password. This reduces the proportion of the password that is repeating. Ensuring that you have not “padded” the password by adding lots of the same characters, it is likely to help meet length requirements and can help reduce the proportion of the password that is vulnerable.</h2>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Patterns are groups of characters that may not appear directly in a dictionary, nor will they be the first thing an algorithm will guess. However, a smarter guessing algorithm will look for predictable patterns such as alphabetic in addition to unmodified alphabetic strings as a likely inclusion to dictionary attacks.</p>

					<br><br>
					<div id="pattern" style="display: none;" class="advice">
						<h2>The easiest way to prevent patterns appearing in your password is to avoid common patterns. . When creating passwords try to use numbers in the middle of the password, do not use letters in alphabetical order such as 'abc', do not use common keyboard patterns and make sure you don’t start a password with a capital letter.</h2>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The issue with reusing passwords is that if a system is compromised where you were using that password, then it is possible that the attacker may learn that password. Thus, a malicious user can guess that password for any of your accounts. This would then mean that even a password that for all practical purposes is impossible to guess is useless if it is used for multiple accounts.</p>
               		<button id ="reusingButton" class="button">Advice</button>
					<br><br>
					<div id="reusing" style="display: none;" class="advice">
						<h2>The greatest countermeasure to reusing passwords is to build strong memorable passwords for each account you access. Passphrases are a better suited countermeasure and can possess the same properties as a strong password should and with the benefit of being much easier to remember. Another countermeasure that could be taken is a password manager. These are available across mobile and desktop applications and can be used to store your passwords.</h2>

                    <p>The reason it is important not to use common passwords or words that exist in a dictionary is because these are easily guessed by password cracking algorithms, meaning that a complex password is still weak if it exists within either of these lists.</p>
